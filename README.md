## Project Overview

Normative modeling has recently been put forward to characterize heterogeneity within cohorts with neuropsychiatric disorders and enable individual-level analysis. Despite their popularity, normative models of magnetoencephalography (MEG)-based functional neuroimaging-derived phenotypes (f-IDPs) are still lacking. In this project, we utilized the [**MEGaNorm**](https://pypi.org/project/meganorm/) and [**PCNToolkit**](https://pypi.org/project/pcntoolkit/) to derive normative models for f-IDPs of resting-state MEG (rs-MEG) recordings for the first time. The models were trained on a large (1,846 participants), lifespan-spanning (ages 6–88), multi-site (6 scanner sites) dataset using hierarchical Bayesian regression (HBR) with a Sinh-Arcsinh (SHASH) likelihood. We incorporated age as a covariate, and sex and acquisition site as grouping effects. These normative ranges can support treatment outcome evaluation, subtyping, and diagnosis. The normative models retain individual variation and provide individual-level participant profiles.

### Steps:

- We first preprocessed the recordings and isolated periodic activity in the power spectrum. Features (relative theta, alpha, beta, and gamma power) were extracted and averaged across sensors.

- We compared two HBR models: **Non-linear, heteroscedastic, and non-Gaussian**, and **Linear, homoscedastic, and Gaussian**, using a range of model diagnostics. Our results showed better performance for the non-linear, heteroscedastic, and non-Gaussian model.

- To demonstrate clinical application, we used deviation scores to distinguish Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients from healthy participants. We reported AUC scores across f-IDPs by running the models 10 times on different train-test splits. Extreme deviation statistics showed higher positive deviations (Z > 2) in theta and negative deviations (Z < –2) in beta in PD patients compared to controls.

- Furthermore, we introduced a dimensional approach to characterize heterogeneity across PD patients, treating abnormalities as a spectrum rather than categorical distinctions.

- To support individual-level interpretation, we developed **Individual-level Neuro-Oscillo Charts (I-NOCs)**—visual tools that quantify and display individual deviations, enabling personalized assessment of functional brain dynamics.
